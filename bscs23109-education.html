                        <li><span class="black-background">I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from one of Pakistan's best IT-focused universities, Information Technology University (ITU). The reason for joining ITU is the same as for many others: its prestigious and well-rounded faculty, along with its research-oriented curriculum that encourages you to learn and explore what's happening in the technological world right now.</span></li>
                        <li><span class="black-background">I chose BSCS because the world of technology is evolving rapidlyâ€”faster than we can learn about it. But if we can grasp the fundamentals of technology, we can build upon it like pieces of blocks by continuously adding new technologies and advancements to our personal building. However, to turn that building into a long-standing skyscraper, the foundation should be rock solid. That's where Computer Science comes in. I believe it will equip me with all the necessary tools to learn and get familiar with what's to come in terms of technology, whether it's Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, or Cybersecurity. Computer Science is the basis of all of this.</span></li>
